// Step 1 Begin your application by declaring a variable called coinFlip. Do not assign the variable a number just yet.
// var coinFlip

// Step 2 Create a for loop that loops a certain amount of times. The amount of times that the for loop executes will be collected from the user via a prompt.
for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++)
again = prompt('Run application again? (y or n)', 'y');

// Step 3 Within the for loop assign a randomly generated number to You will have to use the same Math formula that you used in the previous assignment to get this number.
// console.log(prompt(‘Select Heads or Tails));
// var coinFlip = Math.round(Math.random()) + 1;

// Step 4 Use a conditional statement to check the result of the coin flip. If it’s 0, write out “Heads” into the console window. If it’s 1, write out 
// “Tails” into the console window.
// if (flipResult == "0") {
//        alert("Heads");
//    } else {
// if (coinFlip == 1) {
//        alert("Tails");
//    }

// Note: Unlike the previous assignment, you’re not prompting the user for their choice. You’re simply displaying the coin flip results in the console.
